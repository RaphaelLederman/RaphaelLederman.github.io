My name is Raphaël Lederman, I am passionate about financial markets and data science.
I am currently working as a Graduate Analyst in Global Markets at Deutsche Bank in London. I graduated from a post master's degree in Big Data at Télécom Paris-Tech in 2019, with a particular focus on statistics, machine learning, deep learning, SQL and NoSQL, and graduated from the Master 203 - Financial Markets at Paris-Dauphine University in 2018. I have held several positions as an analyst in complex derivatives trading (Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, OTCex), and I love finding innovative ways to use data science in the financial markets ecosytem. 

Besides financial markets and data science, I have also studied applied economics and law and have been developing a considerable interest in various areas from human sciences (I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Philosophy in parallel to my post master's degree in data science) to music (I obtained a degree in classical music studies with highest distinction and the violin first prize of the 5th arrondissement conservatory of Paris).
