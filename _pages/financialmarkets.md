### Multi-Asset Portfolio Management : Building a Macroeconomic Momentum Indicator

In this paper, I focus on momentum, a preponderant risk factor, applied to macroeconomic indicators.

After carrying out an investigation on the academic literature linked to macro momentum strategies, I constructed an aggregated indicator using various relevant macroeconomic signals in order to shape an allocation strategy. The resulting macroeconomic momentum strategy, involves the translationof this aggregated indicator into tactical allocations within a multi-asset portfolio framework.

The last part of this paper provides empirical performances and interpretations arising from the study.

### Alternative Finance : Study on Bitcoin

This study on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of Bitcoin in order to develop a potential derivatives valuation framework consistent with the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. In the context of this work, I used Bitcoin traded volumes and volume-weighted prices from ten major exchange platforms from the year 2013 onward.

The first part exhibits Bitcoin’s singularities, from the point of view of the price evolution and the market as a whole, with a particular focus on the non-Gaussian distribution of returns and the lack of liquidity on major exchanges. I then question the sources of such extreme features, and investigate the probable impact of very unstable demand mechanisms and behavioral biases. Finally, I consider the Bitcoin as a type of commodity from the perspective of it’s structural attributes as well as it’s price evolution, and therefore open up the path to corresponding modeling approaches.

In the second part, I provide an econometric study. I consider and test various models, the most relevant finally being an Exponential GARCH model based on asymmetric innovations and Student’s T noises, with fine tuned parameters.

### Exotic Derivatives Trading : The Valuation and Hedging of Multi-Underlying Autocallable Structured Products

The aim of this paper is to provide a in-depth analysis of the most popular (and most heavily traded) type of structured product : autocallables. 

I wrote it as an anaylist in exotic derivatives trading at Société Générale, and focused on three main aspects : 
* The struture and sensitivities of such products to different variables (the greeks)
* The theoretical models used to provide consistent quotes for correlation, volatility, interest rates and dividends, and the numerical method used for pricing (Longstaff-Schwartz Monte-Carlo)
* The challenges linked to the hedging of such discontinuous structures using traded derivatives

Finally, I provide thoughts about a potential new methodology for quoting implied correlation between stocks.
